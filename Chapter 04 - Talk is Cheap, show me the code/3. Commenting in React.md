Comments are a integral part o any coding experience. You can have the best coders in the world, have them write almost self explanatory code, and yet when shown their own code after some time, they'll be lost.

Comments are micro documentations of your code explaining your code to anyone reading it in the future, including self.

We comment in react just like we comment in JS using the double `/`.

```
// This is a comment.
```

But for JSX, we need to include everything in curly brackets and then use the `/*` and `*/`. Like so...

```
<>
    <div>
        {/*<h1>This is a comment in JSX</h1>*/}
    </div>
</>
```
