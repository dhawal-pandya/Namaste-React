In React, `props (short for properties)` are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are essentially read-only and used to pass data down the component tree, as opposed to state, which is private to a component and can be modified within the component.

Suppose, you have a component called App that renders a Welcome component. The Welcome component needs to display a greeting to the user, but the greeting itself comes from the App component.

In this case, the App component could pass the greeting message to the Welcome component as a prop:

```
// In the App component
{
return <Welcome greeting="Hello" />;
}
```

```
// In the Welcome component
{
return <h1>{props.greeting}</h1>;
}
```

In this example, the App component is the parent component and the Welcome component is the child component. The greeting prop is passed from the parent App component to the child Welcome component. The Welcome component then displays the greeting by rendering an h1 element with the value of the greeting prop.

Props can be any type of data, including numbers, strings, arrays, and even objects. They can also be passed to child components that are nested several levels deep in the component tree.

It's important to note that props should be treated as read-only and should not be modified within a component. If a component needs to modify data, it should use state instead.
