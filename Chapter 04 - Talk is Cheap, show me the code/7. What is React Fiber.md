React Fiber is a new reconciliation engine that was introduced in React 16. It is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm, which is responsible for determining how the virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is updated in response to changes in the component tree.

One of the main goals of React Fiber is to improve the performance of React apps by allowing the reconciliation process to be broken down into smaller, more granular steps. This can be especially useful for improving the performance of complex or large apps, as it allows React to prioritize and update the most important parts of the virtual DOM first.

React Fiber also introduces a new concept called "priority levels", which allows React to assign different priorities to different updates. This can ensure that high-priority updates, such as user input, are handled quickly, while low-priority updates, such as background tasks, can be done later.

Also, Fiber also introduces new features and APIs that can make it easier to build complex and interactive user interfaces. React Fiber has the phenomenon of "suspense", which allows components to "wait" for asynchronous data to be fetched and loaded before rendering.

Overall, React Fiber is a significant improvement to the React reconciliation engine, and it offers a number of benefits for building high-performance and interactive user interfaces with React, and makes it that much faster.
