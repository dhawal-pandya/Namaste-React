A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers that are distributed across the world and are used to 'deliver content' to people more efficiently. CDNs are used to improve the performance and availability of websites, applications, and other services by caching static content, such as images, videos, and even JavaScript files as the libraries.

The best example is the React-CDN, which provides the entire code of React for us to use by adding just a link to our HTML file. It can be found on this [site](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html).
