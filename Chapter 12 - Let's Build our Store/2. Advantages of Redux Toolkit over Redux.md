Redux Toolkit is a set of tools and utilities designed to simplify the development of Redux-based applications. It provides a faster and more intuitive way to work with Redux, making it easier to write scalable, maintainable, and efficient code. Here are some advantages of using Redux Toolkit over Redux:

    Simplified setup: Redux Toolkit provides a simplified setup for creating a Redux store. It automatically configures the most commonly used Redux middleware, such as Redux Thunk and Redux DevTools, and allows you to create a store with just a few lines of code.

    Reduced boilerplate: Redux Toolkit eliminates much of the boilerplate code that is required when working with plain Redux. It provides a set of concise and intuitive APIs for defining actions and reducers, which can greatly reduce the amount of code you need to write.

    Improved type safety: Redux Toolkit provides improved type safety by using TypeScript to define the types of actions and reducers. This makes it easier to catch errors early in the development process and provides a more reliable codebase.

    Easy debugging: Redux Toolkit provides a built-in DevTools extension that allows you to debug and inspect the state of your application. This can be a valuable tool for finding and fixing bugs in your code.

So basically, Redux Toolkit provides a faster and more intuitive way to work with Redux. It simplifies the setup process, reduces boilerplate code, improves type safety, provides immutable state management, and makes debugging easier. If you are using Redux in your application, Redux Toolkit is definitely worth considering as a way to simplify your code and improve your development experience.
