    Dispatch: Dispatch in Redux is a method that is used to send an action to the store. It is the only way to update the state in a Redux application. When you call dispatch(action) in your code, the store runs the action through its reducer and updates the state accordingly.

    Reducer: A Reducer in Redux is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state of the application. The reducer is responsible for updating the state based on the action that was dispatched. It must always return a new state object and should never modify the existing state directly.

    Action: An Action in Redux is a plain JavaScript object that describes an event that has occurred in the application. It contains a type property that specifies the type of action that has occurred and may contain additional data that is needed to update the state. Actions are usually defined in a separate file and are imported into the component that will dispatch them.

    Payload: A Payload in Redux is additional data that is included in an action. It is the data that is needed to update the state of the application. The payload is an optional property of an action object and can be of any type.
