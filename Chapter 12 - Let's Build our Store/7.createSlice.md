In Redux Toolkit, createSlice is a function that generates a Slice of the Redux store. A Slice is a collection of related Redux logic, including actions, reducers, and selectors, that can be used to manage a specific part of the Redux store, a logical separation of the Store

Here is the configuration that createSlice takes:

```
createSlice({
  name: string,
  initialState: any,
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: {},
})
```

Here's what they mean individually:

    name: A string that specifies the name of the Slice. This name is used to generate the action types for the Slice.

    initialState: An object that represents the initial state of the Slice. This is the default state that the Slice will use if no state is provided when the store is created.

    reducers: An object that contains a set of reducer functions. These reducer functions describe how the state should be updated in response to actions dispatched to the store. Each key in the reducers object represents an action type, and the value is a reducer function that updates the state.

    extraReducers: An object that contains a set of additional reducer functions. These extra reducer functions can be used to handle actions that are not specific to the Slice, such as actions from other parts of the store. Each key in the extraReducers object represents an action type, and the value is a reducer function that updates the state.
