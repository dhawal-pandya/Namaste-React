Suspense is a component in React that allows for declarative loading and handling of asynchronous data and code. It works in conjunction with lazy() and provides a way to show loading content (e.g. a spinner) while a component that is being loaded asynchronously is being fetched and parsed.

By wrapping a component that is being loaded asynchronously with Suspense, you can specify what should be displayed while the component is being fetched and parsed. This way, instead of having to handle loading and error states manually in your code, you can declaratively specify what should be shown to the user while asynchronous data is being loaded.

In short, Suspense provides a way to handle the loading state of asynchronous content in a declarative way, improving the developer experience and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written to handle loading states.
