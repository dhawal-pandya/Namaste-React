JSX has many superpowers that make it a useful tool for building user interfaces:

- Expressions: JSX allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript, which can make it easier to understand and write UI code. This is instead of the verbose `React.createElement`.

- Performance: JSX is compiled by Babel to native JavaScript code, so it is as fast as writing raw JavaScript.

- Integration with React: JSX is often used with the React library, and it is designed to work with React. You can use JSX to manipulate the structure of a React component using just JavaScript, and React will efficiently update the DOM to match the structure of the JSX element without issues.

- Reusable components: You can use JSX to define reusable components that can be rendered in multiple places in your application. This can make it easier to build and maintain large applications.

### But

JSX has a few syntax rules that you need to follow, such as using camelCase for HTML attributes and specifying the class attribute as `className`. So, once you get used to these rules, `JSX` is very powerful.
