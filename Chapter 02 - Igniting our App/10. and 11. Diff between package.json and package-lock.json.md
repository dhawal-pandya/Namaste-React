`package.json` is a file that is used to define the dependencies and scripts for a project along with the configs. It is usually located at the root of the project, and it contains information about the project, such as the name, version, and description, and a list of dependencies and scripts that are used by the project.

Here is an example of what a package.json file might look like:

`{
"name": "my-project",
"version": "1.0.0",
"author": "Dhawal Pandya",  
"description": "My cool project",
"dependencies": {
"dep1": "^4.17.15",
"dep2": "^2.24.0"
},
"scripts": {
"build": "parcel",
"test": "jest"
}
}`

In this example, the package.json file defines a project called "my-project" with version "1.0.0". It has a description of "My cool project", and it lists the `dep1` and `dep2` libraries as dependencies. The scripts section defines two scripts that can be run using the npm run command: a `"build"` script that runs Parcel, and a `"test"` script that runs Jest.

`package-lock.json`, on the other hand, is a file that is used to **lock** the dependencies of a project to specific versions. It is automatically generated by NPM based on the dependencies that are installed in the project, and it includes detailed information about each dependency, including the version and the exact location of the package, and its dependencies as well.

It includes detailed information about each dependency, including the `version number` and the exact location of the package. This information is used by the package manager to ensure that the same versions of the dependencies are installed on every machine that uses the project. This avoids the famous _Works on my Machine_ problem.

## Why is it not a good idea to edit `package-lock.json`?

This is because the file is genereated by the npm everytime you run the build script using the 'npm'. The changes we make to it, will be overridden by the npm commands. Also, if you do modify the file, you will introduce unneccesary errors into your project, the manual primming of the nodes and their dependencies is almost always bound to errors, hence we use 'npm' to make any changes, such as updating or installing a package.
