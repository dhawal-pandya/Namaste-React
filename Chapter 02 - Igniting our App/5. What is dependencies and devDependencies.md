`dependencies` and `devDependencies` are keys in the `package.json` file. They list the names and versions of the tools required for your project to function. There is also a special system of naming the version of the tools.

The list in `dependencies` is the list of techs you need for your project to function successfully, but not the ones you need as a developer when you are building your project.

The list in `devDependencies` is the list of tools you need when you are building your project. The best example for this is the `parcel` bundler package. It bundles your project ino neat files thta you can 'distribute' via a server, but the program that does this bundling need not be on the client side when rendered. Also, the size of these techs may be huge, depending on their dependencies. So when you add techs to the `devDependencies` key, they are only executed during production.

By separating your dependencies and devDependencies, you can ensure that only the necessary packages are installed in production, which can help to keep your production environment lightweight and efficient.
