The callback function of useEffect cannot be declared as async because the useEffect hook expects a synchronous function as its callback.

An async function, by definition, is a function that returns a promise and can be paused at any point using the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve. However, when an async function is passed as the callback to useEffect, it will return a promise and the useEffect hook will not know when that promise is resolved or rejected.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and might cause issues when trying to synchronize the state with the DOM.

Instead of using an async function, you can use async/await inside of a normal function.

```
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await axios.get('/data');
    setData(response.data);
    }
    fetchData();
}, []);
```

In this example, the callback function is not an `async` function, but inside it, it calls a function `fetchData()` which is async and it uses the `await` keyword to wait for the response from the server.
