lazy() is a utility function in React that allows for lazy-loading of components. It works by deferring the loading of a component until it is actually needed (i.e., when it is displayed on the screen). This can improve the initial loading performance of an application by only loading components that are actually required.

In React, components are usually loaded and parsed immediately when the application starts, even if they may not be needed right away. lazy() allows you to load a component only when it is needed, potentially improving the performance of your application.
