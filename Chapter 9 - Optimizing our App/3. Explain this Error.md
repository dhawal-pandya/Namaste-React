A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition?" What does all this mean and how to fix it?

This error message is related to the use of Suspense in React. It means that a component is trying to use Suspense to handle the loading state of asynchronous content, but it is doing so in response to a synchronous user interaction (e.g., clicking a button).

In React, Suspense is designed to be used for asynchronous data loading, not for synchronous interactions. If a component that uses Suspense is triggered by a synchronous interaction (e.g., a button click), it can cause the entire UI to be replaced with a loading indicator, as the error message suggests.

To fix this issue, the updates that trigger the Suspense component should be wrapped with startTransition. startTransition is a utility function that allows you to schedule updates that use Suspense to be executed asynchronously, ensuring that the updates do not interfere with the normal flow of the application.

For example, you can wrap the updates in a setTimeout or use an animation library to perform the updates asynchronously. This way, the updates will be executed after the current interaction has completed, avoiding the issue of synchronous updates triggering Suspense.
