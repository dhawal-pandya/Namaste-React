We declare a variable with name 'json' which has to wait till a promise is resolved and that value has to be put as its assignment.
Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task.

```
const json = await data.json();
console.log(json);
```

The function uses the "await" keyword to pause execution until the promise returned by the "fetch" function is fulfilled. Once the promise is fulfilled, the function continues execution, and the data from the server is logged to the console.

Using 'await' stops the execution of the JS file, till the promise is fulfilled, so since it is entirely put in an useEffect hook, which will execute only after the component has been rendered, all UI elements will be loaded once the json variable is assigned.
