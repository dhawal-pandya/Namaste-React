Monolithic architecture is a more traditional software design pattern where an application is built as a single, unified unit. This means that all the components of the application, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, are built into a single executable point. The monolithic architecture is a simple and easy to understand architecture, as all the components of the application are combined in a single codebase.

In monolithic architecture, all the components are tightly coupled, meaning changes in one component can affect the entire application. This can make development, testing, and deployment more difficult and time-consuming, as a change to one component requires the entire application to be rebuilt and redeployed.

Some advantages of monolithic architecture include:

- Simple and easy to understand, as all the components of the application are combined in a single codebase.
- Easy to develop and test, as all the components are in the same codebase and can be tested together.
- Easy to deploy, as the entire application is deployed as a single unit.

So basically, monolithic architecture is suitable for small and simple applications that do not need to be scaled or are not expected to change frequently. As the application and the organization grow and the need to scale or make frequent changes arise, monolithic architecture can become a bottleneck and a microservices architecture may be a better fit.
