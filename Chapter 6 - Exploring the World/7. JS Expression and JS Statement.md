In JavaScript, a statement is a piece of code that performs an action, while an expression is a piece of code that returns a value.

A statement is a command that is executed by the JavaScript interpreter, such as an assignment statement (e.g., x = 5), a control flow statement (e.g., if, for, while), or a function declaration (e.g., function foo() {...}). Statements do not return a value, they are executed for their side effect.

An expression is a piece of code that is evaluated to produce a value, such as a variable (e.g., x), a literal value (e.g., 5), or an operator (e.g., +). Expressions can be used on the right side of a statement, such as in an assignment statement (e.g., x = 5 + 2), or they can be used to produce a value that is used in some other way, such as in a return statement (e.g., return x + y).

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between a statement and an expression:

```
let x = 5; // this is a statement, it assigns the value 5 to the variable x
let y = x + 2; // this is an expression, it evaluates to 7 and assigns the value 7 to the variable y
```

Here, the first line is a statement that assigns the value 5 to the variable x. The second line is an expression that uses the + operator to add 2 to the value of x and assigns the result to the variable y.
