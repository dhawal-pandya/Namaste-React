"async" and "await" are two keywords in JavaScript that are used to handle asynchronous operations.

"async" is a keyword that is used to declare a function as asynchronous. An asynchronous function is a function that is executed in the background, without blocking the execution of the rest of the code. Asynchronous functions return a special type of object called a "Promise", which can be used to track the completion of the asynchronous operation.

"await" is a keyword that is used within an asynchronous function to pause execution of the function until a promise is fulfilled. When an asynchronous operation is started using the "await" keyword, the function will pause until the promise is fulfilled and its value is returned, then it will continue the execution.

Here's an example of how to use "async" and "await" to handle an asynchronous operation:

```
async function getData() {
const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
}
```

Here, the getData function is declared as asynchronous using the "async" keyword. The function uses the "await" keyword to pause execution until the promise returned by the "fetch" function is fulfilled. Once the promise is fulfilled, the function continues execution, and the data from the server is logged to the console.
