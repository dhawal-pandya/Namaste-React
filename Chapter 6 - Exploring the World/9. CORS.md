CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that block web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is done to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of the user.

For example, if a web page served from "example.com" makes a request to "api.example.com", the browser will block the request because the domains are different. This is because web pages are not allowed to make requests to a different domain for security reasons.

However, some web applications need to make cross-origin requests. For example, a web application that is served from "example.com" might need to make requests to an API that is served from "api.example.com". In this case, the web application can use CORS to make cross-origin requests.
