The useEffect hook is a way to add side effects to your React components.

A "side effect" is any behavior that affects the component or the application outside of the component's render method. Some examples of side effects include fetching data from a server, setting up a subscription, or updating the document title even.

The useEffect hook is called after the component has rendered and it takes two arguments: a function that contains the side effect code and a list of dependencies.

```
useEffect(() => {}, [dependencies])
```

The function passed to useEffect is called an effect. It is called immediately after the component is rendered, and also after every re-render if the dependencies haven't changed.

The list of dependencies is an array of values that the effect depends on. If any of the dependencies change, the effect will be called again. If you pass an empty array as the second argument, the effect will only be called once, after the initial render.

The useEffect hook can even be used to have the side effect of fetching data from a server.

```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
const MyComponent = (props) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    useEffect(() => {fetch('https://my-api.com/data').then(response => response.json()).then(data => {setData(data);
        });
    }, []);
// passing empty array as second argument
    if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }
    return <div>{data.message}</div>;
};
```

In this example, the effect is a call to the fetch function, which retrieves data from a server and stores it in the data state. Since we passed an empty array as the second argument, the effect will only be called once, after the initial render.

It's worth noting that useEffect is a powerful hook that can be used for different purposes, it can be used to handle subscriptions, interact with browser APIs and much more, with the right usage it can make your components more powerful and flexible.
