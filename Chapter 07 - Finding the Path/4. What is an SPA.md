A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without having to refresh the entire page. This results in a more seamless and responsive user experience, as the app feels more like a native application.

React, being a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, can be used to build SPAs by breaking down the application into smaller components, and then using React's virtual DOM to efficiently update the components as the user interacts with the app.

In a React-based SPA, the initial HTML page is loaded from the server, and then React takes over and renders the components on the page. As the user interacts with the app, React updates the components in the virtual DOM and then updates the actual DOM with the minimal necessary changes, resulting in a faster and more efficient update process.

React Router is a library that can be used in a React-based SPA to handle client-side routing. It allows you to define different routes for different parts of your app and to update the components displayed on the page based on the current URL, without having to refresh the entire page.

Here's how you can use React Router to handle client-side routing in a React-based SPA:

```
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
return (
    <BrowserRouter>
        <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    </BrowserRouter>
    );
}
```

In this example, the `<BrowserRouter>` component is used to wrap the entire app, and the `<Route>` components are used to define the different routes for the app. The path prop is used to define the URL path for the route, and the component prop is used to define the component that should be rendered for that route. The `<Link>` components are used to create links that navigate to the different routes.

React-based SPAs can also be designed to work with a server-side rendering (SSR) setup, which can improve the performance of your app by rendering the initial view on the server before sending it to the browser, this could improve the time to first paint and improve the SEO of your app.
