Client-side routing and server-side routing are two different ways of handling routing in web applications.

- Client-side routing is a technique where routing is handled entirely on the client side, typically using JavaScript. The client-side router intercepts clicks on links, and instead of making a full page request to the server, it updates the browser's URL and renders the appropriate view based on the URL, all of this happens on the client side, no request to the server is necessary. The advantages of this approach are that the app feels more like a native application, with faster navigation and no page reloads.

- Server-side routing, on the other hand, is a technique where routing is handled on the server. When a user clicks on a link or enters a URL into the browser, the request is sent to the server, which then determines which view to render based on the URL. The server then sends the appropriate HTML to the browser, which then updates the view. The advantages of this approach are that it's more SEO friendly, and it has better performance for the first load, since the browser doesn't have to wait for a bunch of JavaScript to execute.

It must be said that you can also use a combination of both techniques, in what is called Universal or Isomorphic Routing, this approach allows you to use client-side routing for fast navigation and server-side routing for SEO and better performance on the first load.

In summary, client-side routing is a technique where routing is handled entirely on the client side, typically using JavaScript, it allows for faster navigation and no page reloads. Server-side routing, on the other hand, is a technique where routing is handled on the server, it's more SEO friendly and it has better performance for the first load. Universal Routing is a combination of both techniques that allows you to use the best of both worlds.
