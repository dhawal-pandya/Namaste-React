Optional chaining is a new syntactic sugar introduced in JavaScript (added in ECMAScript 2020) that allows you to access the properties of an object without having to check if the object or its parent objects are null or undefined.

For example, consider the following object:

```
const obj = {
  a: {
    b: {
      c: 'hello',
    },
  },
};
```

To access the value of c using traditional JavaScript, you would have to check if each object in the chain is defined:

```
let cVal;
if (obj && obj.a && obj.a.b) {
  cVal = obj.a.b.c;
}
```

With optional chaining, you can simply use the ?. operator to access the property:

```
const cVal = obj?.a?.b?.c;
```

If any part of the chain is undefined or null, the whole expression will evaluate to undefined. So, it isn't true that there is no checking, but that the check is built into the syntax itself.

You can also use optional chaining to call a function on an object, if the object and the function both exist.

```
const obj = {
  a: {
    b: {
      c: 'hello',
    },
  },
};
const cVal = obj?.a?.b?.c();
```

In the example above, if any of obj, obj.a, or obj.a.b are undefined, the entire expression will evaluate to undefined and the function c won't be called.

You can also use Optional Chaining to assign a value to a property.

```
const obj = {};
obj?.a?.b = "hello";
console.log(obj);
```

In this example, obj.a will be created as an object, and inside it obj.a.b will be created the value of b will be set to "hello".
