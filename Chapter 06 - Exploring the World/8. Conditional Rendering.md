In React, conditional rendering is the technique of showing or hiding a component based on certain conditions. In functional components, this is achieved by using JavaScript expressions and control flow statements within the component's JSX to determine what should be rendered.

Here's an example of how to use conditional rendering in a functional component:

```
const Example = ({isLoggedIn}) => {
    if (isLoggedIn) {
        return <div>Welcome back!</div>;
    } else {
        return <div>Please log in.</div>;
    }
};
```

In this example, the component Example receives a prop isLoggedIn and based on the value of this prop, it renders a different message. If the value is true it will render "Welcome back!" otherwise it will render "Please log in."

Another way to achieve conditional rendering in functional component is to use ternary operator and logical AND operator:

```
const Example = ({isLoggedIn}) => {
    return (
        <div>
        {isLoggedIn ? <div>Welcome back!</div> : <div>Please log in.</div>}
    </div>
    )
}
```

It's also possible to use the Logical AND operator to conditionally render a component. The logical AND operator && will only evaluate the right-hand side if the left-hand side is true.

```
const Example = ({isLoggedIn}) => {
    return (
        <div>
        {isLoggedIn && <div>Welcome back!</div>}
        {!isLoggedIn && <div>Please log in.</div>}
        </div>
    )
};
```

These examples are quite simple, but conditional rendering can also be used to control the visibility of more complex components. It's important to keep in mind that the conditions used for conditional rendering should be simple and easy to understand, as complex conditions can make the code hard to maintain.
