Shimmering is a visual effect used in UI design to indicate that a loading process is in progress. It is a repeated animation of a set of thin horizontal or vertical lines, or dots, that appear to be moving or shimmering, or even just empty boxes to be filled.

The effect is meant to be subtle and unobtrusive, and is often used in situations where data or content is being loaded asynchronously, such as when a UI is waiting for a response from a server.

This is done in the place of the loading spinner, usually.

Shimmer effect can be done in different ways, it can be done using CSS, javascript and some libraries such as react-shimmer.

Shimmer is a useful technique that can help to improve the user experience by providing visual feedback when data is being loaded, and it can help to keep the user engaged and prevent confusion.
