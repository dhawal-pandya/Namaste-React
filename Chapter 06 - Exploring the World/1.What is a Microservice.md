Microservices are a software architecture design pattern where large applications are broken down into smaller, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific thing and is in communcation with other services through APIs. This way development, deployment, scaling and tolerance all are increased.

Some advantages of microservices include:

- Faster development and deployment, as services can be developed and deployed independently of each other.
- Improved scalability, as services can be scaled up or down independently of each other.
- Improved fault tolerance, as a failure in one service does not necessarily affect the entire application.
- Easier to understand and maintain, as services have a limited scope and are organized around business capabilities.

So basically, microservices architecture is suitable for large, complex applications that need to be developed and deployed quickly and scaled easily. It's not always the best fit for small or simple applications, as the added complexity may outweigh any benefits.
