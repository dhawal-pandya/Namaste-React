Manipulating the DOM using JavaScript is possible but very verbose. The React library is written using JavaScript, and it does allow some reduction in the code, but still it is not a good choice to try to emulate HTML code in JavaScript by using the built-in React functions like createElement, and so on. Hence, `JSX` was born. It is allegedly an acronym of "JavaScript XML", which by itself is an acronym of "eXtensible Markup Language".

`JSX` is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript code. It is often used with libraries like React to build user interfaces.

Here is an example of `JSX`:

`const ele = <h1>Namaste JSX</h1>;`

In this example, ele is a `JSX` element that represents a h1 element. So when a `JSX` element is compiled, it is transformed into a JavaScript object that represents the DOM element.

`JSX` elements can also contain JavaScript expressions, which are evaluated and inserted into the `JSX` element at runtime. For example:

`const name = 'Albus'; const ele = <h1>Namaste, {name}!</h1>;`

In this example, the `JSX` element is equivalent to the following JavaScript code:

`const ele = React.createElement('h1', {}, "Hello, " + name + "!");`

`JSX` is not a part of the JavaScript language, so it must be transformed into JavaScript code in order to be used in a JavaScript application. This is typically done using a transpiler like Babel. But also, never confuse `JSX` with actual HTMl.
