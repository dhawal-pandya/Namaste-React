Here's an example of how you can bind data in a functional React component using the useState hook:

```
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setName(event.target.value);
  };

  return <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

In this example, the "name" state variable and the "setName" function are created using the useState hook. The "name" variable is bound to the value of the input field, and the "handleChange" function is bound to the "onChange" event of the input field. When the user types in the input field, the "handleChange" function is called, which updates the "name" state variable. As a result, the component is re-rendered, and the input field is updated to reflect the new value of "name".

React's useState hook allows you to add state to functional components, which were previously unable to manage their own state. This can make it easier to build and maintain complex, data-driven applications using functional components, as it allows you to declaratively specify the relationships between the data and the UI. However, it is important to understand the principles of one-way data flow in order to use React effectively.
