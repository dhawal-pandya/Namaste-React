If we try to console.log a useState, or any hook for that matter, it will output what ever the hook returns.

It is no different than trying to console.log a function which returns an array, with specific elements.
So if I do this:

```
console.log(useState("Hello"));
```

This is what I shall get in return:

```
Array [ "Hello", dispatchSetState() ]
```
