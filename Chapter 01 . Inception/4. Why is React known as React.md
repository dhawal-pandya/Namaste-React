React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook, and the name "React" was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or "reactive." The library was designed to "react" to changes in data.

When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface. The name "React" reflects this reactive nature of the library.
