React is a JavaScript library for building reusuable components, while ReactDOM is a separate library that is used to render React components to the Document Object Model (DOM); that is a website.

Since both are seperate libraries, they are called seperately as well.

```
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

The above one is just React, which is used to create the components.

The below one is the ReactDOM, which is used to render the created components to the site.
