The entire purpose of a library and a framework is to make the developer write code in a less verbose way and increase the effeiency.

A library is a collection of code that is written not in your code, but is called from an external source elsewhere. Libraries are smaller in size and are made to solve essentially smaller problems. Libraries have ready-to-use functions in them, which the developer has access to solve problems.

A framework is essentially a collection of libraries that are all interdependent and function as a single unit and hence have to be used as a single unit. Meaning, it has a very specific way of being used. They provide entire scaffolds for the developer to code their program into. Because of the scaffolding, which requires the developer to code in a certain way, with a resonable degree fo freedom, it is common to call it 'opinionated'. This lack is freedom is compensated by the sructure and stability provided by a framework.
