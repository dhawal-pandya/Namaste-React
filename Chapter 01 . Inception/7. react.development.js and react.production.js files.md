These links call the development libraries for React and ReactDOM. These can be opened and read, and are actually written with the intention of being understood by the developer who wrote it. Everything is properly documented with comments explaining the variables and the purpose of the functions. But this results in the file size growing significantly. For a site that is to be only used by the development team, it is fine. But for production, the file will take visibly too long to load.

```
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production. Production codes are minified and optimized production versions of the same React file, but take us much less space, and hence are easily sent across the internet for usage by the common user who will not notice much smaller loading lag.

```
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
