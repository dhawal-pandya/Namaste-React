ES6 is the relatively newer version of the JS language. It introduced so many new features in the language, that is it taken as a benchmark for modern browsers. It introduced newer way to declare functions, variables, and also made the language less prone to errors. So updating your skills and coding using ES6 or newer syntax is always a good idea.

Absolutely not, is the short answer to the question of it being mandatory.

ES6 is polyfilled by Babel into code that can be run by older browsers anyway. So it is not required by any chance. You can rest assured while coding using arrow functions that it will be made to run in any browser you set in the numinous `.babelrc` file.

You can write React in any JS version you want to.
