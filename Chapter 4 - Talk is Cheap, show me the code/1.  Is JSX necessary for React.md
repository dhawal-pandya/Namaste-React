JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript code. It is often used with libraries like React to build user interfaces.

It is not necessary to use JSX to write ReactJS, but, for the sake of sanity of the developer writing the code, it is very extensively used.

Observe, you can either write this, without JSX

```
const title = React.createElement("div",null, [React.createElement("h1", null, "Here's the Title"), React.createElement("h2", null, "Here's the subTitle")])

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.setElementbyId("root"));
root.render(title);
```

Or you can write this...with JSX

```
const title = <div>
                <h1>Here's the Title</h1>
                <h2>Here's the subTitle</h2>
            </div>

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.setElementbyId("root"));
root.render(title);
```

So you can see the choice between choosing one or the other is rather difficult choice./s
