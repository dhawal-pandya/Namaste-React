Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature that allows you to update parts of your application "on the fly" while the application is running, without having to perform a full reload of the page.

You need to use a JavaScript bundler that supports HMR, such as Webpack or Parcel for it to manifest. You also need to include HMR-specific code in your application, which will handle the process of updating the application when changes are made.

When you make a change to your code and save the file, the HMR system will detect the change and automatically update the relevant part of the application. For example, if you make a change to a React component, the HMR system will update the component in the browser without having to perform refresh. It is especially useful for large applications where a full refresh of the page can be slow and disruptive.
